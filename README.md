# Fuzzy Logic and PID Control for TurtleBot

## Overview
This project showcases a TurtleBot control system using fuzzy logic and PID controllers for autonomous navigation. The robot performs tasks such as right-edge following, obstacle avoidance, and combining behaviors to navigate efficiently and smoothly in dynamic environments.

## Features
- **Fuzzy Logic System:** Processes sensor data with membership functions and rules to make real-time decisions.
- **PID Controller:** Provides precise control for path-following.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Utilizes front sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
- **Right Edge Following:** Maintains a safe distance from the edge using side sensors.
- **Adaptive Logic:** Combines edge-following and obstacle avoidance based on sensor inputs.

## Sensors
- **Right Sensors (RFS, RBS):** Detect distances for edge-following.
- **Front Sensors (F, FR, FL):** Monitor obstacles for collision prevention.

## How It Works
1. **Sensor Inputs:** Data from sensors is processed to evaluate proximity.
2. **Fuzzy Membership Functions:** Map sensor values to defined categories.
3. **Rules and Logic:** Fuzzy rules determine the robot's behavior (e.g., speed and direction adjustments).
4. **Defuzzification:** Converts fuzzy results into actionable outputs for robot movement.
5. **Conditional Logic:** Determines whether to follow the edge or avoid obstacles.

The robotâ€™s linear velocity is fixed at 0.1, while angular velocity is adjusted dynamically based on fuzzy outputs or PID calculations.
